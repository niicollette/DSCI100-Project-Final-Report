    "The Pacific Laboratory or Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) is a research group based at the University of British Columbia working in the Department of Computer Science. At it's core, their research focuses on artificial intellgience (1). In their most recent project, the PLAI has been collecting data from player in a Minecraft server to create an advanced AI that can respond like a real person (2). The goal is to develop learning algorithms and scaffolding for embodied (i.e., intelligent systems with a virtual or physical body with sensing, decision-making, and acting, that allows them to interact with real-world or simulated environments) AI that can be used for Minecraft NPCs and even different fields.\n",
